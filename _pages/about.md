## About Me
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the School of Information Engineering at [China Jiliang University (CJLU)](https://english.cjlu.edu.cn/) and another degree in Computer and Information Science at [Auckland University of Technology (AUT)](https://www.aut.ac.nz/), advised by Dr. Lin Xiang and Dr. Haijun Tao.

My research interests lie in [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)](#), [Human-AI Interaction](#) and [Machine Learning](#), especially the societal impact of technologies, surrounding sustainability, privacy leakage, and social justice concerns in general. I also have a great interest in [Game Design and Development](#).
